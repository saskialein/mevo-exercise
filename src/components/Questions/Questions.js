                    My last job as an Account Manager and Product Coordinator at ANZ Nature Tours has been my favourite job so far.
                    I am a big fan of New Zealand, and it was great fun and an honour to organise tours for European clients, as
                    for many of them, a trip to Aotearoa has been a long 'bucket-list dream', and they have saved a significant amount of money
                     to travel around the world to make this dream come true. 
                    <br />
                    Additionally, I was responsible for maintaining our tour operator software, participating in software update webinars and passing new techniques and knowledge on to the team.
                    <br /> I appreciated having this little extra responsibility and helping workmates whenever they were stuck.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Besides that, I also enjoyed the people I worked with. It was a friendly and fun atmosphere, and I enjoyed going to work each morning.
                    The good team environment in which everyone valued one another was powered by daily team huddles (stand-ups).
                    Sharing our feelings, daily workload, achievements and roadblocks with each other opened up a whole new level of connection and  
                    support and it balanced out the work more evenly amongst everyone.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We also had monthly 1:1s with our Operations Manager to discuss our performance, achievements, issues, 
                    frustrations and goals, and a chance to give and receive feedback.

                    Something that I wish to have as part of my job is to get the chance to grow continually, 
                    learn something new and work towards something that I care about, surrounded by a team who supports me
                    but also pushes me out of my comfort zones.

                I have been a fan of Mevo since I saw one of the cool Audi e-trons outside of the Left Bank Arcade for the
                    first time in 2017.  <br />
                    I remember, it immediately caught my attention, and I went straight to your website to check out this innovative service.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Looking at the Mevo fleet today and also browsing through your press articles, it is fascinating as well as almost relieving to see,
                    how quickly the concept of sharing a car grew in popularity and with that, the increased chance to lower emissions and make a positive
                    impact on our future.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Besides being a big fan of your service (and your European cars), I am impressed by your 'digital first' approach and ambitious technology,
                    like the keyless access to vehicles with mobile apps or the home zone indicator in your cars.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe that Mevo is a company that allows me to grow at immense speed and it would genuinely excite me to work with your team behind the scenes
                    to enable more people to have access to shared cars.
